M.I.A.'s fiance dismisses split reports -
 
But Bronfman has now fired back at the speculation on his Twitter.com blog, blasting reports suggesting M.I.A. is a bad mother for her shocking Super Bowl stunt.
In a series of posts on Thursday (09Feb12), he wrote, "its (sic) sad to see our media in such a state unfounded gossipy nonsense when there are real problems in the world.
And Bronfman can't understand all the controversy surrounding M.I.A. - because he thinks she's done well balancing work with motherhood.
He added, "new song, great. new video, great. superbowl (sic) performance, great. MIA as a mom, great."
Directing a message to M.I.A. herself, he posted, "Can't say it enough - Don't let them flip the script - you're a great mom and ikhyd loves you."
