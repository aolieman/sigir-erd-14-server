Officials are reviewing care at the Saul and Claribel Simkin Centre, where Lillian Peck, 93, suffered as her skin became infected by her own feces and later ruptured.
"The evidence further showed staff were uncertain and lacked confidence in their knowledge of the wound and how to treat it."
"The skin was black. At one point, one of the doctors thought she might have flesh-eating disease, that's how dark it was," Marsha Palansky said Monday.
"I literally broke down. I could not believe anybody could be in that condition."
Peck had not been washed after bowel movements, Palansky said. She died from heart and renal failure two days after being moved to the hospital.
The Winnipeg Regional Health Authority has apologized to Peck's family and said it is reviewing standards at all nursing homes in its jurisdiction.
Seven nurses have been disciplined, including one who no longer works at the home, and the facility has implemented an improvement plan.
"It should not have happened," said Real Cloutier, the authority's chief operating officer.
"A big part of this was ... just not following the protocols in place."
Palansky said she hopes no one else will go through what she has.
"I'm hoping that this home becomes a quality long-term care home," she said. "But I don't think a lot of education (of staff) has happened."
