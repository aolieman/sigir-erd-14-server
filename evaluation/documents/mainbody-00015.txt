Nokia E72 Vs. Nokia E75 Unlocked
 
Print this article
The Nokia E72 and E75 smartphones have many features in common, but being sold by U.S. carriers isn't one of them. That doesn't mean they won't work in the U.S., though. In fact, because they can be unlocked, both will operate on U.S. carriers if you install the selected carrier's SIM card and purchase an unlock code from the manufacturer. While the E72 was produced specifically for T-Mobile, the E75 is not sold by U.S. carriers and must be unlocked before it can be used with one. Aside from their inter-carrier capabilities, there are no differences between the normal and unlocked versions of these phones, but there are several key differences between the phones themselves.
