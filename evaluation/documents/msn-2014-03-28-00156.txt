Maxwell has promised fans there will be a few surprises on his forthcoming tour.
The singer will be joined by Jill Scott, Erykah Badu and Melanie Fiona on his third tour in two years, and he says he's made changes to the set list.
"We're doing songs that we don't really always do, because I've gotten so many requests for those songs," he said. "It would be blasphemous if I didn't do this song or that song."
While Maxwell and Jill perform separate sets, he's hoping that at some point they can join together on stage.
"Once we get into a flow, which is coming pretty soon, I think we'll ultimately be able to craft or do something," he said.
He's also hoping to meet more listeners, teaming up with Renaissance Hotels for meet-and-greets in various cities.
"It was fun," he said of a recent get-together in Chicago, joking: "I wish I could have had more to drink - but it's all about soda water and wine and things like that right now, seeing that I'm on the road."
