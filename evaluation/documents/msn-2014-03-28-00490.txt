Power certainly has the power to corrupt more than to produce magic remedies to our never-ending woes, as Behenji and many of her mercurial peers in politics would vouch for.
Coming up after a wave of resentment swept the nation in the aftermath of countless scams, Uttar Pradesh, the sprawling epicenter of India's influential cow-belt, was high-priority for Congress more than any other party.
The Lok Pal bill related agitations and the Team Anna campaign divided the polity in such a way that that there was no clarity on who stood where and for what. As expected the contentious bill generated much sound and fury but failed to pass muster in Parliament.
The Congress tried to project the image that it has actually tried to bring in the legislation, which was thwarted by the Opposition parties.
The audience India's grand old party was trying to address during the debate was definitely the Uttar Pradesh electorate, more than anyone else, as Team Anna had made it clear in unequivocal terms that it would campaign against Congress in poll-bound states.
Another compelling reason for Congress to go for the kill in UP is Rahul Gandhi, but no prizes for guessing why the younger Gandhi invested so much in UP, which sends the maximum number of lawmakers to Lok Sabha.
