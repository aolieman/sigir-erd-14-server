IronStone Bank plans Seattle branch 

IronStone Bank, a division of First Citizens BancShares Inc. of Raleigh, N.C., said it plans to open a Seattle location in the fourth quarter of this year.
The bank will be located in Fisher Plaza at 100 Fourth Ave. N. IronStone has locations Texas, Arizona and California, and was recently given federal approval to open branches in Colorado, New Mexico and Oregon. The bank has been in operation since September 2002.
IronStone must get approval from the Office of Thrift Supervision to open its Seattle location. It will be staffed by "locally experienced bankers," according to Jay Parker, president of IronStone's western franchise, who added that the bank will concentrate on "professionals and small to midsized companies."
First Citizens also owns IronStone parent Atlantic States Bank, which has 34 offices in Florida and Georgia. This week, Atlantic States Bank changed its name to IronStone.
