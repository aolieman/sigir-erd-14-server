Roberts beaming at movie premiere 

Hollywood superstar Julia Roberts lit up London with her beaming smile at the gala premiere of her new film, Eat Pray Love.
Looking elegant in a white Stella McCartney tuxedo suit, the Pretty Woman star, 42, said she wants people to be moved by the romantic drama, which is based on the best-selling memoir by Elizabeth Gilbert.
"I hope this movie inspires people to take a little bit more time out for themselves, and to appreciate what they have," she said on the brightly coloured carpet, which was decorated with floral arches.
The mother-of-three did not disappoint the hundreds of fans who turned out to support the Oscar-winning actress at the capital's West End, signing autographs and posing for photographs.
Eat Pray Love, which also stars Javier Bardem, James Franco and Richard Jenkins, follows the newly divorced author as she quits her job to embark on a quest of self-discovery - feasting in Italy, finding the power of prayer in India and rediscovering inner peace and love in Bali.
"It has been a great challenge. It's a great book, a brilliant character and a wonderful cast," said Roberts.
"Filming in each country had its own challenges and appeal," she continued, adding that she admired Gilbert for being "so smart and funny".
Director Ryan Murphy described his leading lady as "stunning", while Gilbert admitted she never thought that she would one day be portrayed on the big screen by Roberts, who has starred in blockbusters such as Erin Brockovich, Notting Hill and My Best Friend's Wedding.
Brigitte Nielsen and Ali Bastian were among the celebrities spotted at the premiere.
