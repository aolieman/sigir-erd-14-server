Criminal Defense in Phoenix, AZ
Criminal defense attorneys handle a number of issues related to someone who has been arrested and/or charged with a criminal offense or criminal conduct. Being arrested or charged with criminal conduct is a serious issue for individuals who may not have done what the prosecutors or arresting officers claim they did.
The problem is keeping these individuals out of court and stopping the offense from being filed. When a criminal offense has been filed, even if it is later appealed or expunged, the record of the filing still remains. This makes life quite difficult in the future. If you have been arrested or charged with criminal conduct, it's important to hire a highly qualified criminal defense attorney.
Essential Evidence The Law Office of Robert W. Precht--at www.lawofficeinphoenix.com--helps individuals dealing with criminal conduct cases to avoid going to court, or in the worst case scenario, going to prison. The first thing a good criminal defense lawyer must do is try to stop the charges from ever being filed. To do this, Mr. Precht must conduct his own investigation into the charges as quickly as possible. It's important to gather evidence that could be critical to the case.
Criminal defense lawyers are also entitled to the presumption of innocence for their clients. Until the prosecution can find enough factual information and hard evidence to prove the individual in question is guilty, they are presumed innocent.
Your Defense Attorney When you need the best criminal defense attorney that will fight for your freedom, contacting the Law Office of Robert W. Precht via www.lawofficeinphoenix.com is the right choice.
